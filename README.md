## ðŸŽ§ uxn-akwf â€” Dirt Branch

This repository contains **SuperDirt-ready WAV conversions** of AKWF/uxn waveforms.
This branch (`dirt`) contains WAV-converted versions of the raw sound files from the main branch.

Itâ€™s meant for easy use with SuperDirt in TidalCycles.


The files are about **2.20 MB** on disk.
